What Goes Around Doesn't Come Around -- Yet

I arrived late at a gallery opening of Robert's girlfriend, Joanna. When I saw Robert, he was talking to girl I didn't recognise. I walked over, and smiled and nodded hello to him. "Norman," he said, "this is Louise. -- Louise, Norman -- Louise has an interesting solution to the world's problems."

I could see from the crack of his smile that he was having more fun than Louise realised.

"Uh-huh?" I asked, looking at Louise.

"Well, you see, I have a degree in biochemistry," Louise began, "and when I was a student I came up with a plan to solve the problem of over-population."

"Uh-huh?" I was wondering whether this was going to relate to AIDS.
