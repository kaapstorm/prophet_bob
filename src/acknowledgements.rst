I can't point to any of the ideas in this book and say that they are mine. I'm not sure who came up with all of them before me, but here are those I remember:

  * Karen Armstrong, who writes about our ideas of God, their origins and history.

  * Jared Diamond, who can tell you where you come from.

  * Robert M. Pirsig, who has applied the idea of quality across all levels of complexity.

This book is also the product of conversations with friends: Anthony; Arthur; Christian; Frank. I bounced ideas off them, and in some cases, just took their ideas. And all they get is a mention in the "Acknowledgements" section.
