Robert once said, "If you have children, you'll know that each of your kids relates to you differently. It's just the same with the way we relate to the Laws of the universe. Our relationship is a personal response. So if one person says that their understanding is correct and someone else's is false, unless they can back up their claim in a provable way, it's about as ridiculous as saying that your relationship with your dad better reflects his nature than your sister's relationship with your dad."
