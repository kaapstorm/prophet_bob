    Original? Everything is derivative.

I can't point to any of the ideas in this book and say that they are mine. I'm
not sure who came up with all of them before me, but here are those I remember:

  * Karen Armstrong, who writes about our ideas of God, their origins and 
    history.

  * Jared Diamond, who can tell you where you come from.

  * Tim Attwell, who says that God is the moment at which the hypothetical 
    future becomes the real present.

This book is also the product of conversations with friends: Anthony; Arthur;
Christian; Frank. I bounced ideas off them, and in some cases, just took their
ideas. And all they get is a mention in the "Acknowledgements" section.
