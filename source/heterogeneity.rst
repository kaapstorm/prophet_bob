Heterogeneity
=============

    "We need many forms of government. We need many religions. We need many
    operating systems. We need many car manufacturers. We especially need 
    people who disagree with me." -- Robert Benelux

Variety is more than just the spice of life.

I am one of those people that like a single answer; a best way. Programming has
what are called "design patterns", which are frequently-used ways of solving
common problems. An easy, practical, and non-programming example is a solution
to the problem of passing through walls. The most commonly-used design pattern
in this case is a door.

But in nature there usually exist many solutions to the same or similar
problems. Many many solutions. Some of them are quite similar, but not
identical.

This is a very good thing, and important, because if one solution doesn't work
out, for whatever reason, there are others that may yet succeed.

This is heterogeneity, or diversity, and Robert was a very strong advocate of
it.
