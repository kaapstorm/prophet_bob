    "A story usually takes the reader through the transformation of the
    protagonist. In my book it is the reader who is transformed." -- Robert
    Benelux, when asked what he believes is the reason for his book's success.

Robert told us that humanity is bigger than any individual, even Jesus, the
Buddha and Mohammed. And in his death, the way his family and friends are
implementing what he taught is evidence that humanity is starting to carry on
where Bob left off. Humanity is our hope.

Put another way, the law of nature is changing us by means of Bob.
