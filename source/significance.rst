Significance
============

    If the universe wasn't made just for us, that doesn't mean we're not
    important. There is a mind-bogglingly enormous amount of very boring stuff
    out there, and we are the most exciting thing we have seen so far. We are
    the universe's best attempt at overcoming chaos. Just that makes us very,
    very important, and the most precious thing there is. -- Robert Benelux,
    "My Best Guess At The Truth"
